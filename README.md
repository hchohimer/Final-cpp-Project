# Final-cpp-Project
## Rebel Database
### A Star Wars Program
#### A Hudson Hohimer Program




This project will focust on designing a program which will allow any member of the Rebellion to locate vital resources and personel accross the galaxy. The small size of this data packet and the ancient programing languege will ensure that the Galactic Empire does not discover this program while allowing Rebel opperatives to...

1. Search for resoruces and personel - Blasters, Cell leaders, Medical Supplies, Standard Rations, ect.
2. Using the search criteria, locate the nearest major transportation hub with rebel friendly suppliers
3. report to the operator the fastest route to receve the requested supplies

This Program will search through the twenty most common systems, and of course, the database will not be connected to a live network, new versions will need to be procured regularly as Cells will not remain static for long.

Good Luck,
*Death to the Emporer and Long Live the Republic*
